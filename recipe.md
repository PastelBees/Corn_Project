Grab two pieces of sliced bread and lay them on a plate.
Grab a knife or any object you use for spreading food.
Scoop the peanut butter from the jar with a knife and spread it onto one of the bread slices.
Clean off the knife so no excess peanut butter will get into the jelly.
Once you're done, scoop the jelly from the jar with a knife and spread it onto the other piece of bread.
Stick the two pieces of bread together and enjoy the sandwich.
